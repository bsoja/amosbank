amosbank
========

A converter/unpacker for AMOS banks (the Amiga programming language)

This project is in its infancy. Current features are:

* listing of sprite/icon bank color palettes
* listing of sprite/icon bank sprites (dimensions, hotspots)
* dumping of raw palette index data for sprites/icons (bitplane to byte-per-pixel conversion is working!)
* listing of Pac.Pic. picture dimensions
* listing of bank names

Planned features:

* extract icons/sprites as PNG files
* write a JSON file with sprite/icon hotspots
* extract Pac.Pic. files as PNG files
